    The academic pressure lately is honestly driving me to the brink! With the mid-term break coming up, every course seems to be piling on assignments and assessments all at once, leaving me utterly suffocated. I've been pushing myself to stay organized, trying to tackle each task systematically, but no matter how hard I try, I just can't focus. Everything around me seems to be conspiring to distract me, making it impossible to settle down and concentrate! This constant pressure feels like an invisible wall standing in my way, shoving me closer to the edge every day. I'm exhausted, frustrated, and overwhelmed, like I'm barely holding on.

    I just need a bit of strength and confidence, something to clear my mind so I can push through this, grit my teeth, and break free from this crushing weight! These endless assignments, assessments, and even all the distractions—please, just give me some relief! I need a chance to get my footing back and escape this relentless cycle. Just a little support to get me through these chaotic, maddening days!

  <div class="smalltext wdith83">The Scripture of Serene Wisdom

      From the boundless Dao, the source of harmony and peace,
      Hear the seeker of knowledge, amidst the turbulence of scholarly trials.
      
      As the ancient pines stand unwavering on the sacred mountains,
      Grant this diligent student the strength to remain steadfast.
      
      When myriad tasks like autumn leaves swirl and cloud the path,
      Bestow clarity of mind, like the calm waters reflecting the moon's tranquil light.
      
      As distractions arise like the morning mist,
      May they dissolve under the gentle gaze of the rising sun.
      
      Inscribe within the heart the virtues of jade—purity, resilience, and balance,
      Foster within the spirit the confidence of the great dragons soaring through endless skies.
      
      Through the sage's wisdom, ignite the inner light that guides through darkness,
      With each step taken, let the path be illuminated, leading to peace and fulfillment.
      
      Bless this journey through the gates of knowledge,
      With the celestial harmony of the Dao resonating deeply,
      Fulfilling the quest with serenity and profound success.

      <img src="images/lao zi.jpg" class="bordered-image" alt="Sample Image">
      <div class="small2text width50">
          <p>1. “The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of all things.”</p>
          <p>2. “When all under Heaven recognize beauty as beauty, there arises the recognition of ugliness. When all recognize goodness as goodness, there arises the recognition of what is not good.”</p>
          <p>3. “Being and non-being produce each other; difficult and easy complete each other; long and short contrast each other; high and low complement each other; sound and voice harmonize with each other; front and back follow each other. This is the eternal way.”</p>
          <p>4. “Heaven and Earth are impartial; they regard all things as straw dogs. The Sage is impartial; he regards the people as straw dogs.”</p>
          <p>5. “Heaven and Earth endure because they do not live for themselves, and thus they can last forever. Therefore, the Sage puts himself last and finds himself in the lead; he is detached from himself and finds himself preserved. Is it not because he is selfless that he can achieve fulfillment?”</p>
